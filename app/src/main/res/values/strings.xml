        <b>Frequently Asked Questions:</b><br />
        <b>1. If I hide the app icon, how can I uninstall the app?</b><br />
        If you&#39;ve hidden the app icon, you can uninstall it by going to your device&#39;s "Settings" > "Apps" > "Manage Apps" and then selecting "FoundYou" to uninstall it.<br /><br />

        <b>2. Why hasn&#39;t the location been updated for a while?</b><br />
        If the location hasn&#39;t updated for a long time, it could be because the device&#39;s connection or location services have been turned off. Also, if the phone is switched off, the app will not be able to update the location.<br /><br />

        <b>3. Should I remove battery restrictions?</b><br />
        Yes, removing battery restrictions is important. The app needs to run continuously, and if battery optimization is enabled, it might restrict the app&#39;s background activity. The app doesn&#39;t drain a lot of battery but will not work properly if the device&#39;s battery is low.<br /><br />

        <b>4. Why isn&#39;t the app working properly?</b><br />
        The app may not function properly if it doesn&#39;t have all the requested permissions. Please ensure all permissions are granted. If problems persist, try reinstalling the app and granting the necessary permissions.<br /><br />

        <b>5. Will the app work on Huawei devices?</b><br />
        Currently, the app might not work properly on some Huawei devices. We are working on a fix for future updates.<br /><br />

        <b>6. Should I keep the app up to date?</b><br />
        Yes, it&#39;s essential to keep the app updated to ensure you have the latest features and fixes. Check for updates regularly.<br /><br />
